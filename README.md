## Twitter Sentiment Analysis
We prepare the sentiment analysis dataset from [sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). The technique we are using is called "Bag of Words". Basically, we find the most 200 common words appear in the dataset. Then, we count the feaquency of those words in each Tweet.
Then we train the model using AutoML and deploy as API using SnapLogic.
